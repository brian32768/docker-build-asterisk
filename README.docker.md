## How to use this image

This image contains Asterisk 18.10.1 built on Debian 11 (Bulleye).

Use it with your own Dockerfile to configure it for your Asterisk server.

The repository is here: [brian32768/docker-build-asterisk](https://github.com/brian32768/docker-build-asterisk).

## Project status 2022-03-08

I need to set up an example of how to use this image, the
repository I have right now is private because it has secrets in it. When it's done I will put
a github link here.
